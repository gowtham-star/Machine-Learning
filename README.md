# Tweet classification using logistic regression

Problem Statement:

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

To build a classification model to predict whether a twitter tweet is related to disaster or not

Solution :

Created a simple logistice regression model using count vectorizer for feature extraction

Dataset taken from kaggle competetion
https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview

train_csv file is used to train the logistic regression model

test_csv file is used to test the model with real data

output_csv file the  which has the final ouput provided by the model
